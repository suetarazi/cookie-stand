                    Salmon Cookies are a delicious, high protein treat! We are a family of fisherman who have enjoyed salmon fishing for years. We have perfected the perfect salmon cookie based on our grandmother's recipe. Years ago, she used to bake a batch of these and send them off with us on our fishing expeditions.<br><br>
                    We have improved upon her recipe by adding chocolate chips and making them dairy-free. They are full of protein (18 grams per cookie) and are rich in Omega-3 acids that are good for the brain. <br><br>
                    They are delicious with a cup of coffee or as a nutritious snack by themselves. 
                    Enjoy your cookies from any one of our 5 worldwide locations listed below.<br><br>
                    We also do catering for special events and can ship to your location, so call for more information.
